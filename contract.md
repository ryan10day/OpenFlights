## CS 225 Data Structures Team Contract (zihengc2-haoyu9-yuen9-rmday2)

Communication

Team Meetings Our team will meet at least once a week every Tuesday from 6-8 PM using Zoom. Each member will rotate being the designated note-taker, starting with zihengc2. Notes will be stored on a Google document, time-stamped for each meeting. The note-taker is also responsible for drafting the weekly development log entry, which is approved by the team at the start of the following week’s meeting.

Assistance Each team member can be contacted through GroupMe and email. Outside of emergencies or other commitments, we commit to responding to emails within 24hours.

Respect The note-taker for the week will also serve as the ‘project lead’ for the weekly meeting. Their role is to ensure that every member of the group has had a chance to speak or state their opinion about a design decision or any other topic related to the final project. All decisions will be accepted by simple majority – while unanimous agreement is preferred, it is not required. By signing this document, each member of the team commits to adhering to the decisions made, even if they personally disagree with them.

Collaboration

Work Distribution Each week, the necessary deliverables for the week will be determined by the full team and each member will volunteer to work on one or more deliverables. If this leads to an unbalanced workload for the week, we will make adjustments as necessary.

Time Commitment To ensure an equal distribution of work, each member is expected to independently work no less than two and no more than six hours per week on the project. If a deliverable ends up taking more time, the rest of the team should be pulled in to assist with the unforeseen complication, with each member taking an equal share of the workload or programming in pairs. It is the team’s responsibility, not the individual’s responsibility, to make sure a weekly deliverable is finished by the end of the week. However if a team member is habitually not completing their tasks, they may be asked – politely – to explain their circumstances. Based on their explanation further actions, such as alerting a staff member, may be taken on a case by case basis decided by the other team members.

Conflict Resolution All conflicts within the team will be decided through a group discussion that will include our project mentor if necessary. Any issues that may be best decided by majority rule may be done through vote.
